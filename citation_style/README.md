# Create your own citation style

The easiest way to create your own citation style
is by using the `latex makebst` tool.
To run it, 
simply type

```bash
latex makebst
```

in your terminal and follow the instructions.

If you would like to just look at all the instructions and change them,
we provide a `citation_style.dbj` file in this folder.
This is the driver for creating the `erc_number_app.bst` citation style
that is included with the template.
To recreate this `bst` file, simply run:

```bash
latex citation_style.dbj
```
